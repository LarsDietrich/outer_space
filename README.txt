Outer Space

## v1

This is a rather farfetched website concept I have that I will be working on over time.  Right now the home page includes a full-screen scene including two rotating planets, one earth-like, & one moon, & four flickering stars. All animations are done in CSS.  No jQuery fallback yet...

Built on a fusion Bootstrap/Boilerplate base.

All bootstrap JavaScript plugins are included.

I renamed HTML5 Boilerplate's style.css to reset.css, added in bootsrap.css & 
bootstrap-responsive.css, and supplemented my own style.css.

I have turned the <head>, <header> and <footer> into PHP includes.

The home page slider is built on jmpress.js, originally downloaded from Codrops.

The about page (which is currently hidden) is essentially a mildly customized port from Arbor.js's home page.

Integrated Gaia Design's queryloader2.js file to preload the entire dome before showing the page.

I like the idea of preloading the site, as long as the loaded product is worth the wait :)

## Included images

All of the included images were downloaded from Creattor.com, or other similar site.  I did not build any of the images, however I did customize a few of them with Fireworks.
